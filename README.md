# 15-Puzzle-Game
a webpage that enables the user to play the game of 15-Puzzle. There’s a 4-by-4 board (implemented as an HTML5 table) for a total of 16 slots.


One of the slots is empty. The other slots are occupied by 15 tiles, randomly numbered from 1 through 15. Any tile next to the currently empty slot can be moved into the currently empty slot by clicking on the tile. 

The user’s goal is to arrange the tiles in sequential order row by row. Using the DOM and the click event, write a script that allows the user to swap the positions of the open position and an adjacent tile. Alert the user of illegal moves (i.e., when the user clicks a tile that is not adjacent to the empty slot). 

Separate  script and CSS rules  from the HTML5 file.
